			 <p>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees.</p></div>
